# NYC Citi Bike Demand Forecasting

Overview:

This analysis forecasts station-level bike demand to optimize redistribution in NYC's Citi Bike system. It processes massive trip data with advanced feature engineering and compares neural networks against LASSO, KNN, and K-means baselines using time-based validation. The model achieves an MAE of 1.91 bikes/hour, supporting efficient fleet management.

Key Findings:

Temporal lag features and cyclic patterns drive strong predictions; the neural network outperforms traditional models. Chronological splits ensure realistic evaluation on unseen data. Results enable precise hourly demand estimates for operational improvements.
